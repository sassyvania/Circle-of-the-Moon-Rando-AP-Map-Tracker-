This pack would not be possible without j_im's infinite patience and guidance with logic scripts.
Thanks to Giga Otomia for the colored map!!

AP autotracking is now implemented

Notes:
Iron Maiden seems to be autotracking!
Setting Ignore Cleansing to ON will basically have the same effect on the tracker as having the Cleansing relic.
Left (add) and right (subtract) clicking the Last Keys item manually sets how many keys you need before Dracula's chamber is accessible.

# To-Do list
1) General Testing
2) Move the checks around until they look all nice with the map
3) Add detailed maps for each area (not a priority because its a lot of work but Would Be Nice)
