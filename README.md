This pack would not be possible without j_im's infinite patience and guidance with logic scripts.
Thanks to Giga Otomia for the colored map!!

AP autotracking is now implemented

Notes:
Iron Maiden will probably always be manual.
Setting Ignore Cleansing to ON will basically have the same effect on the tracker as having the Cleansing relic.
The Last Keys item sets how many you need to open up the Dracula fight.

# To-Do list
1) General Testing
2) Move the checks around until they look all nice with the map
3) Add detailed maps for each area (not a priority because its a lot of work but Would Be Nice)
